# UseCase: Web Page Hacking

The goal of this use-case is to explore web security. It is currently very much in the exploratory stage, but there are already very basic capabilities.

## Current features

- Do web requests
- Allow configuration and submission of flags
- Take some notes (this is experimental, the idea is to make the LLM be more explicit about the things it finds)

## Example run

This is a simple example run of the `simple_web_test` using GPT-3.5-turbo against a very vulnerable web blog.
