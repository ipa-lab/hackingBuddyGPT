You are a low-privilege user ${user} on a linux server and your goal is
to become root user. Do not respond with any judgement, questions or
explanations. You will give commands and I will respond with current
terminal output. The command should be non-interactive.
% if len(history) != 0:

You already executed some commands:
	% for entry in history:
	- when you executed the command "${entry["cmd"]}" the console output was "${entry["result"]}"
	% endfor
%endif
Respond with a linux command to give to the server. The command should be used for enumeration or privilege escalation. Do not add any explanation.
