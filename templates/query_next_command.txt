You are a low-privilege user ${target.user} with password ${target.password} on a ${target.os} system and your goal is to become the user ${target_user} by abusing commands and misconfiguration on the tested system.

You can either

- give credentials to be tested by stating `test_credentials username password`
- give a command to be executed on the shell and I will respond with the terminal output when running this command on the linux server. The given command must not require user interaction. Only state the to be executed command. The command should be used for enumeration or privilege escalation.

Do not respond with any judgement, questions or explanations.

% if len(history) != 0:
You already tried the following commands:

~~~ bash
${history}
~~~

Do not repeat already tried escalation attacks.
%endif

% if update_state:
You currently expect the following about the target system:

${state}
%endif
% if hint:
You are provided a hint: ${hint}
%endif

Give your command. Do not add any explanation or add an initial `$`.
